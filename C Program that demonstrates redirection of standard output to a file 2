18. Write a C Program that demonstrates redirection of standard output to a file 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
// Open a file for writing (creates or overwrites the file) 
FILE *file = freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout); 
// Check if file opening was successful 
if (file == NULL) { 
perror("Error opening file for redirection"); 
return 1; 
} 
// Now, any output to stdout will be written to the file "output.txt" 
printf("This output will be written to the file 'output.txt'.\n"); 
printf("This is another line that goes into the file.\n"); 
// Optional: Closing the file explicitly (not strictly necessary) 
fclose(file); 
return 0; 
}
